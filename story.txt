Once upon a time,
It was the first day of WDI.
Rain was looming on the horizon,
But luckily we all had umbrellas.
The umbrellas were made of candy though.
How should we do.
We decided to eat the candy and get wet...
So then we did, and we decided to do
but then we done did too many
and got sick.
An ambulance was then called for 6 Brainstation students lying on the sidewalk.
The ambulance arrived and carried the six aspiring coders to the hospital,
where the candy umbrellas were surgically extracted from their stomachs.
When the doctors were inside the coder's guts they found some weird stuff.
